Because the words are in alphabetical order, we can speed things up with a bisection search also
known as binary search, which is similar to what you do when you look a word up in the dictionary
the book, not the data structure. You start in the middle and check to see whether the word you are
looking for comes before the word in the middle of the list. If so, you search the first half of the list
the same way. Otherwise you search the second half.

"without pictures or conversations?"
